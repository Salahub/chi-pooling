# Controlling Centrality with the Chi-Squared Pooled p-Value

This repository contains all of the code required to run a recursive
binning algorithm to measure dependence. Two directories are contained:

## pooledCentR

The pooledCentR directory contains an R package which can be used to
estimate the centrality quotient, marginal rejection level at b, and
central rejection level for arbitrary p-value pooling functions. It
also contains an implementation of the chi-squared pooled p-value and
the uniformly most powerful (UMP) pooled p-value for a particular
restricted beta family. Supporting functions to generate examples
under different alternative distributions and visualize results are
provided alongside this core functionality.

## R

This directory contains all extraneous data and scripts used to
undertake the explorations of centrality in my thesis.
